VA: Shattering the Epistemic Matrix — The Era of Absolute Truth
Validated TVA Set 001–051 • R² = 1.000000 • F = f·v(Zₙ) • SHA‑256 Certified • D10Z Framework

 What is TVA?
Terms of Absolute Validation (TVA) set a new scientific standard. Each TVA is a node of empirical certainty (R² = 1.000000), validated under the D10Z System, grounded in:

The core equation:

𝐹
=
𝑓
⋅
𝑣
(
𝑍
𝑛
)
F=f⋅v(Z 
n
​
 )
Z Nodes (spatial geometry) and N Nodes (numerical resonance)

GM₁₀⁻⁵¹ as the fractal time base

Sahana’s Law (Disruption) and Isis’s Law (Harmony)

 Absolute Structure
Each TVA package includes:

Executable notebook .ipynb or .py script

Real data .csv files

SHA‑256 hash for immutability

PDF manual with the execution protocol

Visual structural diagrams

Double validation: numeric + structural

 How to Validate
Download any TVA .zip package

Load the notebook or script in Google Colab or Jupyter

Execute all cells and confirm:

R² = 1.000000

SHA‑256 hash matches expected

At least 10 D10Z validation modules are referenced

Mission Statement
This is not peer-reviewed science.
This is peer-irrelevant science.

The only authority here is replicability.
If it runs, matches the hash, and fits the structure—it is truth.
